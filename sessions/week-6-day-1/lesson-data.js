  "stage": "SHOTS",
  "objective": "By the end of the session, each team will have a reviewed character sheet for the characters in its assigned film and a prop sheet for the story-critical objects, with reference images ready to support consistent image and video generation.",
  "submission": "The transcript says the Mahabharata project deadline is two weeks after this session. It does not identify a calendar date or submission destination. Keep the team sheets and chosen generations with the project until the cohort confirms where to submit them.",
  "estimatedTime": "Class practice plus team production between sessions",
  "difficulty": "Intermediate",
  "goal": "Deliver a source-grounded character sheet and prop sheet for the team’s assigned Mahabharata film, with selected reference images and a documented review pass.",
  "learningObjectives": [

      "title": "Lock the character references",

  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Confirm your team and assigned film",
      "instruction": "Check the Mahabharatha project team sheet. Confirm your team’s film/topic and the image-generation and video-generation leads. Ask the team for a recap if you joined after the earlier planning session.",
      "review": "Your team name, assigned film, and responsible image/video leads agree with the team sheet."
    },
    {
      "title": "Build the character sheet",
      "instruction": "List the characters that actually appear in your assigned film. For each one, gather the approved face and costume references, then adapt the Canva character-sheet prompt. Keep identity references separate from costume references and retain clear placeholders for the supplied images.",
      "review": "The sheet shows the needed characters with consistent faces, costume details, turnaround views, and expressions that match the supplied references."
    },
    {
      "title": "Build the prop sheet",
      "instruction": "Identify story-critical objects from the shot list and the team’s assigned scenes. Use the mother sheet’s character and prop columns as an inventory aid. Create reference images from the official materials or instructor-shared prompt; no complete official prop-sheet prompt was supplied in this source packet.",
      "review": "Each selected prop has a clear name, reference, visual details, and the scene or character it belongs to. Unverified designs are marked for review."
    },
    {
      "title": "Generate, compare, and revise",
      "instruction": "Use the character and prop references while generating the assigned frames. For each failed pass, describe the visible mismatch (identity, scale, formation, anatomy, movement, or texture), choose the smallest useful change, and compare the new result with the reference. After repeated failure, change the approach instead of issuing the same prompt again.",
      "review": "The team can point to the reference, identify what changed between versions, and explain why the selected frame is the strongest usable match."
    },
    {
      "title": "Review motion and make a creative decision",
      "instruction": "Generate motion only from a selected frame. Review body mechanics, scale, camera movement and the intended action. If generated movement misses the goal, consider an edit-based repair such as trimming and reversing a segment, as demonstrated in the session. Record when the shot is a deliberate approximation.",
      "review": "The chosen clip communicates the intended action, avoids obvious physics or continuity failures, and is approved by the team."
    },
    {
      "title": "Coordinate the production handoff",
      "instruction": "Share the latest character sheet, prop sheet, selected references, and unresolved issues with the rest of the team. Invite more than one team member to review major creative decisions. Keep the mythological subject respectful; the instructor explicitly cautioned against spoof treatment.",
      "review": "The team knows which versions are approved, who owns the next task, and which issues still need a decision."

Also remember I have character sheet for main characters. so in the prompts include placeholders whenever a main character is coming. The lighting coloring should be consistent throughout. Also individual prompts for main elemnts such as Gandiva, the game board, chariot wheel etc. The shot list should look world class like the horiziontal shot list they use in hollywood for production."

        "Keep prompting with no reference until the shape changes",
        "Use the supplied formation reference, revise toward it, and document any remaining difference before choosing the shot",
        "Crop the image so the formation is hidden",
        "Treat a visually pleasing result as historically exact"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The session describes the formation as difficult for models to reproduce. A reference image is the useful guide; any remaining mismatch should be treated as a creative approximation, not as a source-accurate result."

      "question": "A character sheet changes the face when you add a costume reference. What should you check first?",

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The Canva prompt explicitly separates face references from the outfit reference. Keeping those roles clear helps avoid importing the wrong face from a costume image."

        "Add more characters to the frame",
        "Upscale before reviewing it"

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The transcript describes trimming and reversing part of a generated shot so it reads as vibration in the final edit, even though the model produced a blast-like motion."
