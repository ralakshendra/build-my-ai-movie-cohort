  "title": "Real Estate Walkthrough Challenge",
  "number": 9,
  "stage": "MOTION",
  "visual": "production",
  "objective": "Create one coherent real-estate walkthrough of about one minute or less as a team, using consistent property references, purposeful image-to-video movement and a Filmora edit with music.",
  "homeworkUrl": "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qHcYXyMzjkQSD6remiUbcOcrgI9wMqELxpDtU2Oxylk/edit",
  "submission": "Share one finished team film in the cohort group. Only one final film is required from each team. Record the final link, review notes and reflection in your Homework Doc.",
  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Select and prepare property references",
      "instruction": "Choose the property images your team will use from the supplied website. Convert unsupported WebP files to PNG or JPEG when needed, verify every file opens, and agree which views anchor the walkthrough.",
      "review": "The selected property is identifiable in every reference and the files open in the team’s production tools."
    },
    {
      "title": "Prepare views for motion",
      "instruction": "Use the supplied images directly or create only the additional angles the walkthrough needs. Nano Banana or GPT Image 2 may recreate the same property at 16:9 or from another angle; the rough-sketch workflow remains a separate demonstration.",
      "review": "The approved stills read as the same property and provide useful start or end frames without introducing a competing building or scene."
    },
    {
      "title": "Generate the walkthrough motion",
      "instruction": "Animate the approved stills with Kling 3.0 Omni or another image-to-video model the team understands. Use start-only or start-and-end frames as needed, and apply the supplied FPV prompt structure when it fits the selected view.",
      "review": "The camera move clarifies the property, respects open space and keeps the architecture recognizable without visible warping or structural drift."
    },
    {
      "title": "Edit one team film in Filmora",
      "instruction": "Choose the useful motion clips, cut them into one clear property walkthrough in Filmora and add music. Keep the finished film to about one minute or less and remove decorative beauty shots that do not help the walkthrough.",
      "review": "The team delivers one coherent walkthrough with supportive music, clear property continuity and a runtime of about one minute or less."

      "title": "Additional-view recipe",
      "prompt": "When the walkthrough needs another view, ask Nano Banana or GPT Image 2 to keep the same property, building and structure while creating the needed angle or a 16:9 composition. Review the result for property continuity before animation."
    },
    {
      "title": "Motion test recipe",
      "prompt": "Choose start-only or start-and-end image-to-video based on the shot. Test a purposeful camera move, then reject or revise any result that changes the architecture, passes through solid walls or breaks the visual continuity of the property."
    },
    {
      "title": "Team edit recipe",
      "prompt": "Arrange the approved motion clips into one real-estate walkthrough in Filmora, add music and trim away beauty-shot filler. Keep the final team film to about one minute or less."

The FPV drone starts from a wide angle into the start image and does a slow dolly in, then gradually increases the speed and enters to the end frame, then does a dollyout and a jib up to reveal a wide angle of end frame. Keep the natural parallax of objects and materials within, strictly don't change any features or objects from the reference image. there is no need to show the drone, it should be a complete FPV visual.",

The camera lifts smoothly and moves along a dynamic, continuous flight path.\n\nMaintaining 100% structural and architectural consistency of the environment: the drone skims low over the circular stone fountain with cascading water, banking gently to the right. It sweeps smoothly past the active fire pit and over the manicured green lawn, maintaining the light-beige neo-classical luxury villa on the left and the lush palm trees on the right.\n\nThe flight continues through the courtyard, executing a precise cinematic curve around the modern wooden pergola and towards the circular cutout wall featuring the manicured bonsai tree.\n\nStyle and Technicals: Hyper-realistic, fluid FPV drone physics, organic motion blur during fast banks, continuous one-take sequence, volumetric golden hour morning sunlight casting long shadows, 8k resolution, photorealistic textures. No cuts, no warping.",

All architectural elements must remain completely rigid and physically static, with zero morphing, warping, stretching, or changing shapes as the camera moves past them.\n\nMotion: The camera glides smoothly and dynamically along a continuous, stable aerial trajectory, strictly through open spaces (not passing through solid walls). Realistically simulate parallax and lens distortion appropriate for an FPV drone.\n\nExclusions & Quality: Clean cinematic output. Absolutely no visible interface elements, no red lines, no drawn path overlays, no brush strokes, and no motion trail artifacts. Professional 4k drone stabilization, crisp textures, natural lighting, and photorealistic depth of field.",

  "checklist": [
    "The team selected and can link the property reference images used.",
